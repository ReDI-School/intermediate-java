We want to design an application to manage a university. This model we want to out source so that anyone can download our
software and use it to manage their university. For the purpose of this exercise we shall limit ourselves to a technical
university which offers Bachelor's Degrees in multiple areas.

The application is not intended to be executable, we simply want to have a blueprint of structuring a university.

To proceed, we shall follow the following steps:

- A brainstorming session where we gather requirements and understand the features we want for our university.
- A design session where we transform the structure above into models.
- A coding session where we transform the structures above into Java code.

This exercise is intentionally left abstract to introduce the students into requirements gathering and introduce then
into how complex design problems can be broken down.

The students are encouraged to use every knowledge they have acquired over the course of this semester.
