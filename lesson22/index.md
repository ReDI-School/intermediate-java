# Lesson 22: Interview questions - algorithms

## Goals
- Learn about the coding interview
- Go through simple coding tasks examples
- Learn where and how you can get better at it

### Examples

**1.FizzBuzz**

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

**2. Reverting a string**

Print out a string in reverse order.

*Examples*
```
Input: Hello World
Outpur: dlroW olleH

Input: This is crazy
Output: yzarc si sihT
```

**2. Most frequent element in an array** (from [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/frequent-element-array/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/frequent-element-array/))

Given an array, find the most frequent element in it. If there are multiple elements that appear maximum number of times, print any one of them.


*Examples*
``` 
Input : arr[] = {1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1}
Output : 1
 
Input : arr[] = {10, 20, 10, 20, 30, 20, 20}
Output : 20
```

**3. Questions Marks** (from [https://www.coderbyte.com/editor/Questions%20Marks:Java](https://www.coderbyte.com/editor/Questions%20Marks:Java))

Have the function `QuestionsMarks(str)` take the `str` string parameter, which will contain single digit numbers, letters, and question marks, and check if there are exactly 3 question marks between every pair of two numbers that add up to 10. If so, then your program should return the string `true`, otherwise it should return the string `false`. If there aren't any two numbers that add up to 10 in the string, then your program should return `false` as well.

For example: if `str` is "arrb6???4xxbl5???eee5" then your program should return `true` because there are exactly 3 question marks between 6 and 4, and 3 question marks between 5 and 5 at the end of the string.

*Examples*
```
Input: "aa6?9"
Output: false

Input: "acc?7??sss?3rr1??????5"
Output: true
```
