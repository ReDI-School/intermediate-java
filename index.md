# Intermediate Java
{: .fs-10 }

Welcome to the homepage of the _Intermediate Java_ course at [ReDI School](https://www.redi-school.org).

On this site we collect all the materials like slides, exercises with solutions, ideas for projects
as well as additional resources that you may/should look into.

## Important

Please follow the instructions from the [Initial Setup](./00-initial-setup) page.

We expect all the students to have all the tools installed and running before the classes start.
